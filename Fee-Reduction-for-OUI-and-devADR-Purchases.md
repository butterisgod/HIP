# Helium Improvement Proposal (HIP): Reduction in Minimum Block Size for OUI and devADR Purchases

## Abstract
This HIP proposes a reduction in the minimum block size required for purchasing an OUI and devADR from the Helium Foundation, to allow for increased developer participation and to spur growth within the Helium IoT network.

## 1. Motivation
The current cost structure imposes a significant barrier to entry for individual developers and small businesses. With the smallest purchasable block being 1 OUI and 8 devADR for 900 USD, many potential network participants are deterred, leading to a decrease in network utilization and innovation.

## 2. Proposed Solution
To make the Helium IoT network more accessible to a broader range of developers, this HIP suggests:
- Reducing the minimum block size for OUI and devADR purchases from 8 down to 1.
- This means developers can host an LNS with just 1 OUI and 1 devADR.

## 3. Benefits
- **Increased Network Participation**: A reduction in entry costs will encourage more developers to participate in the Helium network.
- **Decentralization and Resilience**: More LNS providers can exist on the network, making it more resilient and decentralized.
- **Growth**: A higher number of developers and LNS providers will stimulate innovation, drive network adoption, and enhance the overall development within the ecosystem.

## 4. Potential Drawbacks
- **Revenue Loss**: The Helium Foundation may experience a reduction in revenue due to the lower fees. However, this short-term loss can be counterbalanced by the potential for a more vibrant, utilized, and expanded network, leading to increased long-term gains.

## 5. Implementation
Upon acceptance of this HIP, a grace period of 60 days will be provided to the Helium Foundation to adjust the fee structure and make necessary technical modifications to the purchasing system.
